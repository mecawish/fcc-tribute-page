    <p>Mary Winston Jackson was an African American mathematician and aerospace engineer at the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA), which in 1958 was succeeded by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). She worked at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia, the oldest of NASA's field centers, for most of her career. She started as a computer at the segregated West Area Computing division. She took advanced engineering classes and in 1958 became NASA's first black female engineer.</p>

        <p>Jackson's story features in the non-fiction book <i>Hidden Figures: The Story of the African-American Women Who Helped Win the Space Race (2016)</i> by Margot Lee Shetterly. She is one of the three protagonists in <i>Hidden Figures</i>, the film adaptation released the same year. The film recounts the NASA careers of Mary Jackson, Katherine Johnson, and Dorothy Vaughan, specifically their work on Project Mercury during the Space Race. Jackson is portrayed in the film by Janelle Monáe.</p>

  <b>Mary Jackson</b>: Mr. Zielinski, I'm a negro woman. I'm not gonna entertain the impossible.<br>
  <b>Karl Zielinski</b>: And I'm a Polish Jew whose parents died in a Nazi prison camp. Now I'm standing beneath a spaceship that's going to carry an astronaut to the stars. I think we can say we are living the impossible. Let me ask you, if you were a white male, would you wish to be an engineer?<br>
  <b>Mary Jackson</b>: I wouldn't have to. I'd already be one.</blockquote>

        <p>Though President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s Executive Order 8802 prohibited discrimination in the defense industry, Virginia state law still enforced segregation in the workplace. All work facilities had separate restrooms and cafeterias designated “white” or “colored.” In the company cafeteria, whites could select their food choices and sit in a lunch room. Blacks had to make their food requests to a cafeteria attendant and then go back to their desks and eat. Jackson considered it an indignity to be treated less-than equal to her white colleagues.</p>
        <p>After several months of “separate and unequal” accommodations, Mary Winston-Jackson had had enough. She considered resigning, but a chance encounter with a supervisor changed her mind. After hearing her complaints, Kazimierz Czarnecki invited her to work for him and she accepted. Czarnecki encouraged Jackson to undergo training so that she could be promoted to an engineer. She needed to take graduate-level courses in math and physics to qualify for the job. They were offered in a night program by the University of Virginia, held at the Hampton High School. Since Virginia’s schools were still segregated, she had to obtain special permission to take classes with white students. Jackson petitioned the City of Hampton to allow her to attend the classes.  Jackson ultimately completed the necessary courses, and in 1958 she was promoted to aeronautical engineer and became the first black female engineer at NASA. In time, she developed expertise working with wind tunnels and analyzing data on aircraft flight experiments.</p>
